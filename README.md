# Azure Cost Insights

It's easy to get your Azure Costs out of control. _Wouldn't it be great to get insights of your infrastructure spending in your daily routine?_

Costs are a concern of everyone, developers, product owners and operations.
They come together in Azure DevOps, so why not show these insights there?

Azure Cost Insights is a widget that you can put on your Azure DevOps Dashboard.

This widget is built with the belief that cost insights need to be scoped to your spendings.

## Key Features

- All Azure Subscription (offer) types are supported (like EA, PayG, MSDN, etc.) except CSP
- 1 widget for free, additional widget-instances starting at 1$ per widget per month (in-app purchase)

## Getting started

You need to create an Azure Pipeline for the widget to work. This pipeline is going to download and host your cost-data, used by the widget. [Read the 4 good reasons for 'why the need of a pipeline' here](https://github.com/keesschollaart81/AzureCostInsights.Marketplace/wiki/Why-the-need-of-a-Pipeline).
 
1. Create the build pipeline
2. Queue the build and wait for it to succeed
3. Add the Widget to your Dashboard

Altough it's not rocket science, please take a look in the **['Getting Started'](https://github.com/keesschollaart81/AzureCostInsights.Marketplace/wiki/Getting-started)** because it has some useful tips!
