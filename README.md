## Getting started
 
1. **Create the build pipeline**<br/>
This build pipeline is required to download and host your cost data.

    - Create a new empty build (not release) pipeline and select a (preferable empty) repository
    - Name the pipeline something like 'Cost Insights'
    - Add the 'Download Cost Data' task for each subscription, then end with the 'Publish Cost Data' task 
    - Your pipeline will look like this:

2. **Queue the build** and wait for it to finish before continuing with step 3
    - While waiting, check the tips below

3. **Add the Widget to your Dashboard**<br/>
    Each team can have their own widget, one or more per dashboard.

    Then configure it like you like.

## Tips

- In the trigger's tab, disable the 'continuous' trigger and set a scheduled trigger, for example every night at 04:00 AM.
- When the costs of the added subscriptions are 'high': extend the maximum duration of your build in the 'options' tab (Â±30 minutes per 100.000 $)
- Observe the artifacts of the build, this is the data that will be used by the widget
