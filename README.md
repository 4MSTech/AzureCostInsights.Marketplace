## Getting started

You need to create an Azure Pipeline for the widget to work. This pipeline is going to download and host your cost-data, used by the widget.

1. **Create the build pipeline**<br/>
This build pipeline is required to download and host your cost data.

    - Create a new empty build (not release) pipeline and select a (preferable empty) repository
    - Name the pipeline something like 'Cost Insights'
    - Add the 'Download Cost Data' task for each subscription, then end with the 'Publish Cost Data' task 
    - Depending on your Subscription Type (Pay as you Go, EA, CSP, etc.) you need to select the 'consumption' or the 'usage' API in the 'Download Cost Data' task. [More info here](https://github.com/keesschollaart81/AzureCostInsights.Marketplace/wiki/Getting-Started#subscription-types).
    - Your pipeline will look like this:

2. **Queue the build** and wait for it to finish before continuing with step 3
    - While waiting, You are encouraged you to read the following tips:
    - In the trigger's tab, disable the 'continuous' trigger and set a scheduled trigger, for example every night at 04:00 AM
    - The build pipeline has, by default, a maximum duration of 60 minutes (see the 'options' tab), this might be to short depending on the size of your cost data. It takes ~10 minutes to download the costs for 100.000$
    - Observe the artifacts of the build, this is the data that will be used by the widget
    - Create only 1 cost pipeline, teams (within a project) can share it. Add multiple 'download cost data' task for each subscription

3. **Add the Widget to your Dashboard**<br/>
    - Go to your teams' dashboard and add the 'Azure Cost Insights' widget.
